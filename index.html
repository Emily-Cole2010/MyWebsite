 <h3>
  
  Harry Potter is the main character in the franchise and seems to drag Ron and Hermione into all the <br>
  dangerous stuff he does in the next couple years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was born to James and Lily <br>
  Potter in Godric's Hollow. However, his parents were killed by the Dark Lord when Harry was <br>
  one, so he was raised by his cruel Aunt and Uncle.

  <h3>
   
   Muggle born Hermione Granger was raised by dentists. We don't know much about her childhood, but we do <br>
   know that she was a very bright pupil in Hogwarts and in the Muggle world.  She and her family also enjoyed visiting <br>
   the theater in Shaftsbury Avenue. When she recieved her Hogwarts letter she was extremely keen to learn 
   as much as possible before the school term began. Hermione is also an extremely good witch, one of the brightest of her age. <br>
   She knows many brilliant spells and studies extremely hard if theirs a test, she's a big bookworm.
